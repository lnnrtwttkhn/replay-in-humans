## Introduction

How does the brain use past experience to guide future actions?
A particularly interesting phenomenon in this context is replay, typically described as the reactivation of activity patterns in the brain that reflect previous experiences.

Most insights about replay have come from electrophysiological studies of rodent spatial navigation.
In these studies, replay is often investigated as follows: A rodent navigates a spatial environment, such as a simple linear track.
In the rodent's brain, cells in the hippocampus, known as place cells, are activated when the animal occupies a specific location in that environment.
As the rodent moves along the track, these place cells are activated in a specific sequential order that reflects the animal's trajectory (see @fig-linear-track).

The fascinating part happens when the rodent is asleep or stationary: the same cells that were activated during navigation are reactivated in the same sequential order, but this time on a much faster timescaleâ€”within a few hundred milliseconds (see @fig-sleep-replay).
This phenomenon is called replay.

Replay, however, does not only occur during sleep; it also happens in the awake state.
For example, when the rodent is at the beginning of the track, **forward replay** can depict the upcoming trajectory the animal is about to follow (see @fig-forward-replay).

Moreover, replay can occur not only in the same order as experience but also in reverse.
**Backward replay** is typically observed when the animal reaches a rewarding location at the end of the track (see @fig-backward-replay).

While most replay research focuses on the hippocampus, many studies now show that replay-like sequences are distributed throughout the brain, including areas like the prefrontal cortex and visual cortex.

## Replay in humans

When studying replay in humans, we must consider three key properties: **replay is (1) sequential, (2) fast, and (3) anatomically distributed**.
This poses a challenge for non-invasive neuroimaging, as we need methods with both high temporal and spatial resolution.
